audio_id\amused_1-28_0001.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0002.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0003.wav|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0008.wav|Gad, your letter came just in time.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0009.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0010.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0027.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
audio_id\amused_1-28_0028.wav|Robbery, bribery, fraud,
audio_id\amused_113-136_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0116.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0117.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0122.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0123.wav|She had died from cold and starvation.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0124.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0125.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0126.wav|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0127.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0128.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0130.wav|She was his now, forever.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0132.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0134.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0135.wav|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
audio_id\amused_113-136_0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
audio_id\amused_137-140_0137.wav|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
audio_id\amused_137-140_0138.wav|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
audio_id\amused_137-140_0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
audio_id\amused_137-140_0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0226.wav|That came before my A B C's.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0227.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0230.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0237.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0238.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0240.wav|Wash your hands of me.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
audio_id\amused_225-252_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0029.wav|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0031.wav|They were three hundred yards apart.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0032.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0036.wav|She turned in at the hotel.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0043.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0047.wav|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0055.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
audio_id\amused_29-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0309.wav|White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0310.wav|Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0311.wav|Therefore, hurrah for the game.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0312.wav|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0313.wav|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0314.wav|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0315.wav|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0316.wav|We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0317.wav|He was a wise hyena.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0318.wav|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0319.wav|And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0320.wav|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0321.wav|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0322.wav|This is a common experience with all of us.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0323.wav|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0324.wav|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0326.wav|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0327.wav|They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0328.wav|The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0329.wav|Ah, indeed.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0330.wav|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0331.wav|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0332.wav|Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0333.wav|This is no place for you.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0334.wav|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0335.wav|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
audio_id\amused_309-336_0336.wav|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0449.wav|A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0450.wav|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0451.wav|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0452.wav|Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0453.wav|Eighteen hundred, he calculated.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0454.wav|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0455.wav|I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0456.wav|But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0457.wav|What I saw I could not at first believe.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0458.wav|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0459.wav|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0460.wav|I had forgotten their existence.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0461.wav|Ah, we were very close together in that moment.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0462.wav|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0463.wav|They are his tongue, by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0464.wav|Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0465.wav|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0466.wav|Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0467.wav|And so early in the voyage, too.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0468.wav|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0469.wav|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0470.wav|He spat it out like so much venom.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0471.wav|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0472.wav|He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0473.wav|The night was calm and snowy.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0474.wav|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0475.wav|His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused.
audio_id\amused_449-476_0476.wav|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
audio_id\amused_57-84_0057.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
audio_id\amused_57-84_0058.wav|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
audio_id\amused_57-84_0059.wav|His immaculate appearance was gone.
audio_id\amused_57-84_0060.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
audio_id\amused_57-84_0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
audio_id\amused_57-84_0062.wav|The men stared into each other's face.
audio_id\amused_57-84_0063.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
audio_id\amused_57-84_0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
audio_id\amused_57-84_0065.wav|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
audio_id\amused_57-84_0066.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
audio_id\amused_57-84_0067.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
audio_id\amused_57-84_0068.wav|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
audio_id\amused_57-84_0069.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
audio_id\amused_57-84_0070.wav|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
audio_id\anger_1-28_0001.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
audio_id\anger_1-28_0002.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.

audio_id\anger_1-28_0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
audio_id\anger_1-28_0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
audio_id\anger_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
audio_id\anger_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.

audio_id\anger_1-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.

audio_id\anger_141-168_0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0143.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0144.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0145.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0146.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0147.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0148.wav|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0151.wav|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0152.wav|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0153.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0155.wav|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0158.wav|Does that look good.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0159.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0160.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0163.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0164.wav|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0165.wav|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0167.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
audio_id\anger_141-168_0168.wav|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0169.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0171.wav|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0172.wav|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0174.wav|They were the presage of storm.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0176.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0177.wav|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0178.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0180.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0183.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0184.wav|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0185.wav|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0186.wav|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0189.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0190.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0191.wav|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0192.wav|He did not rush in.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0193.wav|It was edged with ice.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0194.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0195.wav|But a strange thing happened.
audio_id\anger_169-196_0196.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0197.wav|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0198.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0199.wav|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0200.wav|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0203.wav|They were following the shore of a lake.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0206.wav|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0207.wav|How much was it.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0208.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0209.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0210.wav|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0211.wav|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0212.wav|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0213.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0214.wav|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0215.wav|They die out of spite.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0216.wav|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0217.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0218.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0219.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0220.wav|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0221.wav|I don't know why you're here at all.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0223.wav|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
audio_id\anger_197-224_0224.wav|She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0226.wav|That came before my A B C's.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0227.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0230.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0237.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0238.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0240.wav|Wash your hands of me.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
audio_id\anger_225-252_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
audio_id\anger_253-280_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
audio_id\anger_253-280_0255.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
audio_id\anger_253-280_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
audio_id\anger_253-280_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
audio_id\anger_253-280_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
audio_id\anger_253-280_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
audio_id\anger_253-280_0260.wav|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
audio_id\anger_253-280_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
audio_id\anger_253-280_0262.wav|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
audio_id\anger_253-280_0263.wav|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
audio_id\anger_253-280_0264.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
audio_id\anger_253-280_0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
audio_id\anger_253-280_0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
audio_id\disgust_141-168_0141.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
audio_id\disgust_141-168_0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
audio_id\disgust_141-168_0143.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
audio_id\disgust_141-168_0144.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
audio_id\disgust_141-168_0145.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.

audio_id\disgust_141-168_0152.wav|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
audio_id\disgust_141-168_0153.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
audio_id\disgust_141-168_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
audio_id\disgust_141-168_0155.wav|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
audio_id\disgust_141-168_0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.

audio_id\disgust_253-280_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
audio_id\disgust_253-280_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
audio_id\disgust_253-280_0255.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.

audio_id\disgust_253-280_0267.wav|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
audio_id\disgust_253-280_0268.wav|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
audio_id\disgust_253-280_0269.wav|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
audio_id\disgust_253-280_0270.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
audio_id\disgust_253-280_0271.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
audio_id\disgust_253-280_0272.wav|You can take a vacation on pay.
audio_id\disgust_253-280_0273.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
audio_id\disgust_253-280_0274.wav|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
audio_id\disgust_253-280_0275.wav|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
audio_id\disgust_253-280_0276.wav|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
audio_id\disgust_253-280_0277.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
audio_id\disgust_253-280_0278.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
audio_id\disgust_253-280_0279.wav|She said with chattering teeth.
audio_id\disgust_253-280_0280.wav|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0029.wav|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0031.wav|They were three hundred yards apart.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0032.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0036.wav|She turned in at the hotel.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0043.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0047.wav|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0053.wav|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0055.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
audio_id\disgust_29-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0393.wav|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0394.wav|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0395.wav|As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0396.wav|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0397.wav|Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0398.wav|In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0399.wav|And here's another idea.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0400.wav|Manuel had one besetting sin.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0401.wav|The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0402.wav|Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0403.wav|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0404.wav|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0405.wav|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0406.wav|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0407.wav|Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0408.wav|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0409.wav|He could feel a new stir in the land.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0410.wav|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0411.wav|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0412.wav|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0413.wav|But I am at the end of my resources.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0414.wav|Now our figuring was all right.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0415.wav|It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0416.wav|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0417.wav|It is also an insidious, deceitful sun.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0418.wav|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0419.wav|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
audio_id\disgust_393-420_0420.wav|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0533.wav|Dunham, can your boy go along with Jesse.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0534.wav|But Johannes could, and did.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0535.wav|A new preacher and a new doctrine come to Jerusalem.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0536.wav|He would destroy all things that are fixed.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0537.wav|He was an enthusiast and a desert dweller.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0538.wav|What Pascal glimpsed with the vision of a seer, I have lived.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0539.wav|I should like to engage just for one whole life in that.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0540.wav|Yea, so are all the lesser animals of today clean.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0541.wav|The Warden with a quart of champagne.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0542.wav|Without a doubt, some of them have dinner engagements.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0543.wav|I had been born with no organic, chemical predisposition toward alcohol.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0544.wav|He may anticipate the day of his death.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0545.wav|The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0546.wav|I lost my balance and pitched head foremost into the ooze.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0547.wav|Men like Joe Goose dated existence from drunk to drunk.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0548.wav|Also, churches and preachers I had never known.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0549.wav|Do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0550.wav|This also became part of the daily schedule.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0551.wav|All an appearance can know is mirage.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0552.wav|Yet he dreams he is immortal, I argue feebly.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0553.wav|I am writing these lines in Honolulu, Hawaii.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0554.wav|Jack London, Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, Oahu.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0555.wav|Jerry was so secure in his nook that he did not roll away.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0556.wav|Why, he's bought forty pounds of goods from you already.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0557.wav|The last refugee had passed.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0558.wav|And the foundation stone of service, in his case, was obedience.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0559.wav|Peace be unto you and grace before the Lord.
audio_id\disgust_533-560_0560.wav|His mouth opened; words shaped vainly on his lips.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0085.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0088.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0092.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0093.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0094.wav|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0095.wav|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0096.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0097.wav|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0098.wav|Shall I carry you.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0099.wav|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0100.wav|You must sleep, he urged.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0101.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0102.wav|He will follow us soon.
audio_id\disgust_85-112_0103.wav|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0001.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0002.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0003.wav|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0008.wav|Gad, your letter came just in time.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0009.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0010.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0027.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
audio_id\neutral_1-28_0028.wav|Robbery, bribery, fraud,
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0116.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0117.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0122.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0123.wav|She had died from cold and starvation.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0124.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0125.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0126.wav|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0127.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0128.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0130.wav|She was his now, forever.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0132.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0134.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0135.wav|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0137.wav|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0138.wav|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
audio_id\neutral_113-140_0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0141.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0143.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0144.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0145.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0146.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0147.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0148.wav|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0151.wav|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0152.wav|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0153.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0155.wav|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0158.wav|Does that look good.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0159.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0160.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0163.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0164.wav|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0165.wav|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0167.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
audio_id\neutral_141-168_0168.wav|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0169.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0171.wav|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0172.wav|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0174.wav|They were the presage of storm.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0176.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0177.wav|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0178.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0180.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0183.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0184.wav|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0185.wav|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0186.wav|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0189.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0190.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0191.wav|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0192.wav|He did not rush in.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0193.wav|It was edged with ice.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0194.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0195.wav|But a strange thing happened.
audio_id\neutral_169-196_0196.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0197.wav|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0198.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0199.wav|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0200.wav|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0202.wav|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0203.wav|They were following the shore of a lake.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0206.wav|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0207.wav|How much was it.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0208.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0209.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0210.wav|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0211.wav|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0212.wav|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0213.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0214.wav|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0215.wav|They die out of spite.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0216.wav|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0217.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0218.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0219.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0220.wav|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0221.wav|I don't know why you're here at all.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0223.wav|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0224.wav|She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0226.wav|That came before my A B C's.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0227.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0230.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0237.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0238.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0240.wav|Wash your hands of me.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0255.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0260.wav|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0262.wav|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0263.wav|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0264.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
audio_id\neutral_197-364_0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0001.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0002.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0003.wav|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0008.wav|Gad, your letter came just in time.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0009.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0010.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0027.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
audio_id\sleepiness_1-28_0028.wav|Robbery, bribery, fraud,
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0116.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0117.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0122.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0123.wav|She had died from cold and starvation.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0124.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0125.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0126.wav|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0127.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0128.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0130.wav|She was his now, forever.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0132.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0134.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0135.wav|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0137.wav|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0138.wav|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
audio_id\sleepiness_113-140_0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0141.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0143.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0144.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0145.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0146.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0147.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0148.wav|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0151.wav|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0152.wav|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0153.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0155.wav|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0158.wav|Does that look good.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0159.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0160.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0163.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0164.wav|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0165.wav|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0167.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
audio_id\sleepiness_141-168_0168.wav|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0169.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0171.wav|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0172.wav|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0174.wav|They were the presage of storm.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0176.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0177.wav|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0178.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0180.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0183.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0184.wav|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0185.wav|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0186.wav|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0189.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0190.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0191.wav|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0192.wav|He did not rush in.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0193.wav|It was edged with ice.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0194.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0195.wav|But a strange thing happened.
audio_id\sleepiness_169-196_0196.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0197.wav|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0198.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0199.wav|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0200.wav|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0202.wav|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0203.wav|They were following the shore of a lake.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0206.wav|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0207.wav|How much was it.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0208.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0209.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0210.wav|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0211.wav|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0212.wav|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0213.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0214.wav|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0215.wav|They die out of spite.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0216.wav|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0217.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0218.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0219.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0220.wav|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0221.wav|I don't know why you're here at all.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0223.wav|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
audio_id\sleepiness_197-224_0224.wav|She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0226.wav|That came before my A B C's.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0227.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0230.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0237.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0238.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0240.wav|Wash your hands of me.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
audio_id\sleepiness_225-252_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
audio_id\sleepiness_253-280_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
audio_id\sleepiness_253-280_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
audio_id\sleepiness_253-280_0255.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
audio_id\sleepiness_253-280_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
audio_id\sleepiness_253-280_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
audio_id\sleepiness_253-280_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
audio_id\sleepiness_253-280_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
audio_id\sleepiness_253-280_0260.wav|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
audio_id\sleepiness_253-280_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
audio_id\sleepiness_253-280_0262.wav|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
audio_id\sleepiness_253-280_0263.wav|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
audio_id\sleepiness_253-280_0264.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
