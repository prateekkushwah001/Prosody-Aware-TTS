## Reference Audios (Original)

These audios serve as reference samples used to guide the prosody of the generated outputs.

| Reference Audio | Link |
|-----------------|------|
| Reference 1     | [1.wav](Final_Audios/ref/1.wav) |
| Reference 2     | [2.wav](Final_Audios/ref/2.wav) |
| Reference 3     | [3.wav](Final_Audios/ref/3.wav) |
| Reference 4     | [4.wav](Final_Audios/ref/4.wav) |
